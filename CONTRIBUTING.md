# Focus on React component design
- All components must be within their own folder (1 folder per component)
  - A subcomponent is permitted to be within a subfolder of a component folder if it is not used in any other component.
- Each component should have a working storyboard file.
- Each component should have a test file (even if there is no tests in it).
- Each component should link to a CSS file (even if there are no styles in it).

# Maintain an organized directory structure
- There should be a few folders to categorize components and other code:
  - Pages
  - Components
  - Assets (such as shared images and shared json)
  - Model (for parsing GPS data / GPX and consuming them)
