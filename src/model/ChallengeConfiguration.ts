/*
GPS POSITION DATA TYPES
=======================

Position data types like these will always have latitude and longitude.
Sometimes they might also have elevation or time associated with them.
But, these types are always a single position, not a group of positions.
*/

interface Point {
  latitude: number // 90째 >= latitude >= -90째
  longitude: number // 180째 >= longitude >= -180째
}

// This is just a point that has a time.
// Steps are intended to be chained to eachother in order.
// The Path type displays this behavior.
interface Step extends Point {
  time: Date // time
}

/*
GPS LINE-DRAWING DATA TYPES
===========================

Line-drawing data types will use positions to create logical lines.
The most obvious example is an array of positions to create a path.
Since its an array, note that order matters.
Every entry in the array connects with the next and previous entry.
*/

// A path is a series of gps positions.
// However, each point *must* also have time data associated.
type Path = Array<Step>

// Contains a path plus other metadata to be kept.
interface Track {
  path: Path
  metadata: {
    id?: string
    title?: string
    creator?: string
    uploadDate?: Date
    color?: [red: number, green: number, blue: number]
  }
}

// A Waypoint is a line that demarcates a challenge
//  into start and finish lines, plus possible checkpoints.
// A start line and finish line are both types of waypoints.
//
// IMPROVEMENT:
// In the future, maybe a waypoint can two or more points.
// Maybe it could curve, or "close" like a square or circle.
type Waypoint = [Point, Point]

// Contains data about the shape of the race.
// The start, finish, and checkpoints decide the shape.
interface Course {
  start: Waypoint | null
  checkpoints?: Array<Waypoint>
  finish: Waypoint | null
}

// Contains a course and tracks, plus other metadata.
interface Challenge {
  course: Course
  tracks: Array<Track> // SEE FOOTNOTE
  metadata: {
    id?: string
    title?: string
    description?: string
    creator?: string
    uploadDate?: Date
    phoneNumber?: string
  }
}
// FOOTNOTE:
// The type declares that "tracks" is an ARRAY, like [<track>].
// In the schema, "tracks" is a DICTIONARY, like <trackID>: {...<track>}.
// The schema randomly decides what <trackID> is.
// We won't be able to immediately access the ID in the frontend for types.

/*
FIREBASE DB SCHEMA TYPES
========================

These types are used when the firebase data is fetched from the server.
Importantly, Records of Tracks and Challenges are at the root of the database.
The implication is challenge does not store track data, but ids of tracks.
*/

// TrackSchema is no different right now, but if it ever changes, this needs to update.
interface TrackSchema extends Track {}

// ChallengeSchema holds an array of track IDs for the tracks key.
interface ChallengeSchema extends Omit<Challenge, 'tracks'> {
  tracks: Array<string>
}

// The DatabaseSchema represents the type of the entire database.
interface DatabaseSchema {
  challenges: Record<string, ChallengeSchema>
  tracks: Record<string, TrackSchema>
}
